There aren't many sources for iphone development on linux systems. Most sites give examples on using the apple SDK with xcode on MacOSX. This project intends to help with iphone development with open source tools.

Please take a look into the wiki for installation instructions: [Installation](Installation.md).

## Now for Firmware 3.0 ##
Found some time to upgrade to firmware 3.0. This is good news. The bad one - yesterday Apple releases 3.1. We don't have much time and I'm personally not involed in any iphone development anymore. If someone would like to help, be welcome.
